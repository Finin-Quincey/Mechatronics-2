##### RoutePlanningIdeas #####
#### Initial attempt at Route Planning using A* method ####

### Import required libraries ###
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

### Manually write input values - these will be outputted from other code later on ###

##### NOTE TO SELF #####
# When doing A*, will need to make sure it only allows movements between adjacent nodes, not a distant available node.
